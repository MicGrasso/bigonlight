Let us remark that for this test we perform light propagation using forward integration, namely from the source S to the observer O. 
The procedure works well in post-processing but it would reach the full potentiality if used to perform light propagation on-the-fly with the spacetime simulation. 
On one side, the current structure of BiGONLight is not able to perform on-the-fly forward simulation, on the other side this structure has the advantage of being compatible 
with many codes for the spacetime dynamics.
For more references on forward and backward light propagation see Grasso et al. ArXiv:2105.04552 [astro-ph.CO] and Grasso, Villa (2021).
